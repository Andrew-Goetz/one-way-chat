# One-Way Chat

Compile with `make`.

Run receiver, then run sender to start sending messages. For now, code will only work on localhost, as there needs to be added a way for sender to specify IP address of the receiver.

Additionally, receiver requiring a username argument is unnecessary but still mandatory in the current version of the program.

```
Usage: ./receiver [PORT] [USERNAME]
```

```
Usage: ./sender [PORT] [USERNAME]
```
